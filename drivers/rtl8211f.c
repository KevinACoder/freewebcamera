/*
 * @file   rtl8211f.c
 * @brief  Realtek RTL8211F PHY over a borrowed MAC management interface.
 *
 * The standard clause-22 register set does the work: BMCR/BMSR for reset,
 * autonegotiation and link state, the 1000BASE-T control/status pair for
 * gigabit, and the 10/100 advertisement and link-partner registers for the
 * fallback. Everything is reached through the fn_read/fn_write pair handed to
 * Initialize(), so this driver is usable over any MAC's MDIO.
 *
 * Ordering, and why PowerControl is where the strap clear lives: the MAC's
 * power-up pulses the PHY's hard reset line, and that pulse re-latches the
 * strapped RGMII TX delay (see rtl8211f.h). The adapter therefore powers the
 * MAC up first and this driver up second, which is also the order the ports
 * were verified in. A soft reset here does not re-latch straps.
