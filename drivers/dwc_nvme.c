/*
 * @file   dwc_nvme.c
 * @brief  NVMe block driver: controller enable, admin/IO queue pairs, PRP
 *         transfers, and completions delivered as MSI-X over the ITS.
 *
 * See drivers/dwc_nvme.h for the provenance. The queue geometry, the PRP
 * rules, the doorbell order and the cache discipline are the embox driver's,
 * kept step for step:
 *
 *   - A transfer is split so that PRP1 plus PRP2 can describe it (at most two
 *     pages); anything else goes through a page-aligned bounce buffer, which
 *     also covers caller buffers that are not 4-byte aligned or not a whole
 *     number of blocks. A PRP pair that does not describe the buffer sends the
 *     device to the wrong memory without any error.
 *   - The submission doorbell announces the tail *after* the entry is written
 *     (advance first, then ring), with a dsb between the entry/buffer stores
 *     and the doorbell. Getting this wrong lets the controller fetch a stale
 *     entry.
 *   - A completion is read only after invalidating its cache line, and its
 *     phase tag is compared against the expected phase - the tag inverts on
 *     every pass of the ring, so a stale cached line reads as "no completion
 *     yet" forever or as a completion that never happened.
 *   - CC.EN=0 resets controller state, so the sequence is: enable and wait for
 *     CSTS.RDY, only then arm MSI-X, only then create the I/O queue pair with
 *     interrupts enabled (IEN=1, vector 0). Admin commands and any path
 *     without message interrupts stay polled.
 *   - Completion bookkeeping belongs to the submitter: the interrupt handler
 *     records that a completion arrived, the thread that submitted consumes
 *     the entry and rings the CQ doorbell. A handler that advanced the head
 *     would race the submitter's own copy of head/phase.
 *
 * Mechanical differences from the embox original, all noted at their site:
 *   - PCI access goes through drivers/dwc_pcie.h (config access plus a flat
 *     device list) instead of embox's PCI framework;
 *   - MSI-X is programmed by drivers/dwc_msix.c and the ITS mapping comes from
 *     the board's MSI domain (port/board/common/gicv3_msi.c) through include/msi.h;
 *   - the completion wait is "poll the CQE phase, sleeping one tick between
 *     rounds" with the handler only bumping a counter, instead of embox's
 *     wait queue: this project's ISR-safe wake-up (osThreadFlagsSetFromISR) is
 *     adapter-scoped and the waiter here is the calling task inside the
 *     driver. The interrupt is still what makes the wait cheap - the counter
 *     it bumps is also the evidence that message interrupts arrived at all,
 *     which completion alone cannot show (the device posts the CQE whether or
 *     not the interrupt was delivered).
 *   - the queue arrays are per controller. The original sized both I/O queue
 *     arrays with the admin depth and shared one set across controllers; with
 *     one controller on this board that was invisible, with two it would alias.
