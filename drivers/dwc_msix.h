/*
 * @file   dwc_msix.h
 * @brief  MSI-X table programming for a DesignWare PCIe endpoint.
 *
 * Internal to drivers/: an endpoint driver (dwc_nvme.c today, an 802.11 one
 * later) calls these two functions and gets back armed vectors; nothing above
 * the driver layer sees MSI-X at all.
 *
 * PROVENANCE AND PORTING POLICY. This is the behaviour of the author's embox
 * MSI work without the framework underneath it: the ordering discipline comes
 * from src/drivers/pci/msi/pci_msi.c (the 141 lines the author wrote on top of
 * upstream's file, commit da44e283fd) and src/drivers/interrupt/gic/gicv3_its_msi.c
 * (commit da44e283fd, author's own, carried over whole into port/board/).
 * embox's version rides on irq_domain, objalloc pools, dlist and its PCI
 * framework; none of that is vendored here, so what remains is the part that
 * touches hardware, kept step for step:
 *
 *   - mask the entry, order it, write the address/data triple, order it,
 *     unmask - a posted message write observed while the vector is unmasked
 *     can arm a half-written entry (PCIe spec 7.7.2.1);
 *   - hold the function masked (MASKALL) while the entries are programmed,
 *     unmask every entry, and only then raise ENABLE with MASKALL cleared in
 *     a single config write: endpoints sample the table as ENABLE rises and
 *     one that captures a masked state never re-samples;
 *   - the payload written into an entry is the ITS event id, which is also
 *     the entry index - the mapping the ITS glue was written against.
