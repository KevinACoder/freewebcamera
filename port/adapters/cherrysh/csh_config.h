/*
 * @file   csh_config.h
 * @brief  CherrySH configuration for this board.
 *
 * CherrySH ships only a template (`third-party/cherrysh/csh_config_template.h`)
 * and expects the integrator to supply `csh_config.h`. It lives here rather than
 * in third-party/ because third-party/ is vendored byte-identical and never
 * edited; all adaptation belongs in port/adapters/<component>/.
 *
 * The choices worth explaining:
 *
 *  - CONFIG_CSH_NOBLOCK=1: the REPL must not block inside sget(). The shell task
 *    sleeps on an osEventFlags wait and re-enters the REPL when bytes arrive, so
 *    a task that blocks in sget() would never yield and would starve every
 *    lower-priority task. This is what CONFIG_CSH_LNBUFF_STATIC=1 is required
 *    for (csh.h #errors on the combination otherwise) - with noblock, readline
 *    state has to survive between calls, so the line buffer cannot be on the
 *    stack of a call that returns early.
 *
 *  - CONFIG_CSH_SYMTAB=1: commands come from the FSymTab/VSymTab linker
 *    sections (see CSH_CMD_EXPORT* in csh.h). The link script already KEEPs
 *    those sections, so exported commands cannot be discarded.
 *
 *  - CONFIG_CSH_XTERM=0: the console is a plain serial line. Xterm-specific
 *    escape sequences would emit bytes a terminal emulator has to filter, and
 *    more importantly the reader used to capture boot logs is line-based, so
 *    extra control traffic makes bring-up output harder to read, not easier.
 *
 *  - CONFIG_CSH_MULTI_THREAD=0: one shell instance. The multi-thread path calls
 *    chry_shell_port_create_context(), which would need a per-command task;
 *    not wanted here.
 *
 * The rest match the template's defaults.
