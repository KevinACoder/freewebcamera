/*
 * @file   arch/cc.h
 * @brief  Compiler and platform abstraction for lwIP on this carrier.
 *
 * lwIP requires a compiler abstraction header, reached as <arch/cc.h> from
 * lwip/arch.h. Nothing here is an lwIP option (those live in lwipopts.h);
 * these are the platform facts lwIP cannot guess:
 *
 *  - byte order and byte-swap primitives (aarch64 is little-endian; the
 *    protocol headers need the swaps, so they are compiler builtins rather
 *    than a library call),
 *
 *  - LWIP_RAND(): lwIP uses it for the DHCP transaction id and the IPv4
 *    fragment id. There is no rand() in this freestanding image, so the
 *    free-running virtual counter supplies the bits. CNTVCT_EL0 and not
 *    CNTPCT_EL0: the physical counter is gated by CNTHCTL_EL2.EL1PCEN, which
 *    the `go` boot path leaves at 0 (see port/board/board.h) - reading it
 *    traps to the firmware's old EL2 vector table.
 *
 *  - the diagnostic and assertion hooks. The defaults call printf()/abort(),
 *    neither of which exists here (-nostdlib, freestanding). Assertions stay
 *    enabled on purpose during bring-up: a failed lwIP assertion that prints
 *    and parks is findable, one that was compiled out is not.

/* --- ssize_t -------------------------------------------------------------- */

/*
 * lwIP's arch.h uses "is SSIZE_MAX defined?" as its probe for "does this libc
 * provide ssize_t?" and otherwise typedefs `int ssize_t` itself. Newlib does
 * provide ssize_t - in <sys/types.h>, and again in <stdio.h> as
 * `typedef _ssize_t ssize_t` (long) - but it hides SSIZE_MAX, because that is
 * a POSIX limit and this build is -std=c11 (strict ANSI). Left alone, lwIP's
 * `typedef int ssize_t` then collides with newlib's long one, in whichever
 * file happens to include both (lwip/core/mem.c includes <stdio.h> for
 * snprintf, and the vendored sys_arch.c reaches arch.h before lwipopts.h).
 *
 * arch.h includes arch/cc.h before it looks at the probe, so stating the fact
 * here - not in lwipopts.h, whose position in the include order varies per
 * translation unit - is what makes it consistent.

/* --- libc ---------------------------------------------------------------- */

/*
 * lwIP maps lwip_isdigit()/lwip_isspace()/... onto <ctype.h> unless told
 * otherwise, and newlib's ctype macros read the _ctype_ table, which this
 * freestanding image does not link. With this on, lwIP uses its own inline
 * range checks (lwip/arch.h) and the image stays libc-free.
 *
 * Same reason as ssize_t for living here rather than in lwipopts.h: arch.h
 * decides this right after including arch/cc.h, before it has seen lwipopts.h
 * in translation units that reach arch.h through lwip/debug.h.
