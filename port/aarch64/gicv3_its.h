 * @file   gicv3_its.h
 * @brief  GIC-600 ITS / LPI driver: interface and table geometry.
 *
 * PROVENANCE AND PORTING POLICY. The register sequences, table geometry and
 * cache discipline in the driver are ported from the author's own embox
 * contribution (embox/embox, BSD-2, src/drivers/interrupt/gic/gicv3_its.c,
 * commit e93fe1ec0e, board-verified on this SoC 2026-09-06). That driver is
 * the reference: where it makes a choice - a field encoding, an ordering
 * step, an unconditional cache flush - the choice is kept, not re-derived.
 * Re-deriving any of it is how rung 2 of the self-test went silent (see
 * docs/evidence/20260915-m0-bringup.md and the KI-025 note in
 * docs/DESIGN.md).
 *
 * Mechanical differences from the embox original, all noted at their site:
 *   - register/cache primitives are this project's (regs.h, board.h);
 *   - tables live in .bss (identity-mapped Normal RAM) instead of a mmap'd
 *     fixed window - equivalent for the hardware, which reads physical DRAM
 *     over its non-coherent port either way, and one less mapping to keep
 *     in agreement;
 *   - callers address LPIs by raw INTID (IRQ_LPI_INTID_FIRST + slot) rather
 *     than through a kernel IRQ window, matching the CMSIS irq_ctrl.h model
 *     this project uses for SPIs and PPIs;
 *   - the LPI priority byte is a FreeRTOS-safe level, not embox's 0x00.
 *
 * This is not an interface layer: nothing above the board layer should
 * include it. Handlers are registered through CMSIS irq_ctrl.h's
 * IRQ_SetHandler on the LPI's INTID, exactly as for SPIs and PPIs.
