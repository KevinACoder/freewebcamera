/*
 * @file   gicv3_msi.c
 * @brief  Message-interrupt domain on the GICv3 ITS: a PCIe Requester ID
 *         becomes a set of LPIs.
 *
 * PROVENANCE AND PORTING POLICY. The logic is ported from the author's own
 * embox file (embox/embox, BSD-2, src/drivers/interrupt/gic/gicv3_its_msi.c,
 * commit da44e283fd, board-verified on this SoC 2026-09-07 with the NVMe
 * controller's MSI-X interrupts). It is the reference: the DeviceID encoding,
 * the message address/data pair and the (devid, event id) -> LPI mapping are
 * taken from it rather than re-derived. Re-deriving this path is how the ITS
 * went silent before (KI-025).
 *
 * The mapping, in one line: the ITS DeviceID is the PCIe Requester ID
 * (bus << 8 | slot << 3 | func), each vector takes the next free LPI slot, the
 * message address is GITS_TRANSLATER and the message payload is the *event
 * id* - not the LPI number. The endpoint writes "event 2" and the ITS looks up
 * which LPI that is; a payload carrying the LPI number instead would translate
 * to nothing and be dropped without an error anywhere.
 *
 * Mechanical differences from the embox original, all noted at their site:
 *   - the domain is reached through include/msi.h instead of embox's
 *     arch_setup_msi_irqs hook, because the PCI MSI framework is not vendored
 *     (see drivers/pci_msix.c for what of it is kept);
 *   - LPIs are addressed by raw INTID (8192 + slot) and armed by the caller
 *     through CMSIS IRQ_SetHandler/IRQ_Enable;
 *   - a failed allocation unwinds the events it already mapped, which in
 *     embox happened through the caller's teardown;
 *   - the per-function record kept here is what Free() needs to find the
 *     events again (embox walked its msi_desc list).
 *
 * Context: Allocate/Free run in task context - they post ITS commands and wait
 * for the command queue to drain. They are not concurrent-safe against another
 * ITS user (the `its`/`itsdump` shell commands also post commands); today's
 * boot order keeps the allocation at probe time, before the shell is
 * interactive, and nothing calls Free yet.
