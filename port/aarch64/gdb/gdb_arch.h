/*
 * @file   gdb_arch.h
 * @brief  AArch64 (ARMv8-A, EL1) side of the serial GDB stub.
 *
 * The trapframe layout is the contract between the adapter's vector
 * dispatch (tx_vectors.S, which builds the frame) and this stub. It
 * mirrors the FreeBSD/fgdb shape: six saved system registers first, then
 * x0..x29, with LR kept separately so the C struct reads naturally.
