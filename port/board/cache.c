/*
 * @file   cache.c
 * @brief  AArch64 data cache maintenance for the board layer.
 *
 * CMSIS-Core has no AArch64 cache API: the only cache helpers the pack ships
 * are in armv7a_cp15.h, which is ARMv7/CP15 and does not apply to an A55.
 * So this is the one genuinely uncovered primitive, and it is kept here in
 * the board layer rather than exposed as an interface.
 *
 * Cache line is 64 bytes on Cortex-A55. Ranges are rounded outward: cleaning
 * or invalidating a few extra lines is harmless, whereas missing one is the
 * silent-failure mode this exists to prevent. That asymmetry is why the
 * rounding direction is always outward and never "aligned down and hope".
 *
 * This has already bitten this project in five places on this board (IRQ,
 * ITS, GMAC, NVMe, EHCI): shared tables are reached through non-coherent
 * ports, so every CPU write needs a clean before the device reads it, and
 * every device write needs an invalidate before the CPU reads it.

 * its data cache when it jumps to us. Those lines are a trap: our boot code
 * clears .bss and writes page tables straight to memory with caching off, and
 * later - once we turn our own caches on - the stale dirty lines get evicted
 * and land on top of the code, the tables and the stack.

 * problem rather than a memory problem. Draining up front costs a few
