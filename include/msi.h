/*
 * @file   msi.h
 * @brief  Message-signalled interrupt (MSI/MSI-X) domain - a board service.
 *
 * An endpoint's MSI is a posted memory write: the function writes a small
 * payload to a doorbell address, and whichever interrupt controller is behind
 * that address turns it into an interrupt. On this SoC the doorbell is the
 * GICv3 ITS's GITS_TRANSLATER, the payload is an event id, and the ITS
 * translates (Requester ID, event id) into an LPI INTID through tables the
 * board layer owns.
 *
 * That translation is neither a PCIe concern nor an NVMe concern, so it lives
 * behind this tiny interface: the PCIe driver knows *which* function wants
 * vectors (the Requester ID) and programs the endpoint's MSI-X table with what
 * it is handed here; the board layer (port/board/common/gicv3_msi.c) owns the ITS
 * side. Keeping it an interface is also what lets the ITS implementation be
 * replaced (another GIC, another translation scheme) without touching the
 * drivers - the same reason include/pcie.h exists.
 *
 * CONTRACT:
 *  - Allocate() is task-context only: it programs ITS tables, which is a
 *    command sequence, not something an interrupt handler may do.
 *  - `requester_id` is the PCIe Requester ID, BDF as bus<<8 | slot<<3 | func.
 *    It is the ITS DeviceID, so it identifies the function, not the driver.
 *  - `data` in each returned vector is the ITS event id, which is also the
 *    MSI-X table entry index the PCIe side must program. The pair (address,
 *    data) is what goes into the endpoint; `intid` is what the OS arms with
 *    IRQ_SetHandler + IRQ_Enable.
 *  - Free() withdraws the mappings; the caller disables the INTIDs first.
 *  - A domain that cannot serve a request returns a negative ARM_DRIVER_ERROR*
 *    (or a short count from Allocate) rather than pretending: a function whose
 *    vectors never arrive is otherwise indistinguishable from one that never
 *    raises an interrupt.
